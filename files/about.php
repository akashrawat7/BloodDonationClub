                                                                                       and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation
                                                                                       of whole-blood components).  Donation may be of whole blood (WB), or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis).
																					   Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.<br>

																						Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. 
																						In poorer countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).
																						Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow paid donation some donors are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. 
																						Donors can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have  bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.<br>

																						Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, 
																						including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health.

						<center><strong>BLOOD DONATION PROCESS</strong></center><br>                                             
						It is always good to plan blood donation in advance. Consult your doctor before donating blood if there are any health issues or concerns. It is always good to have healthy diet weeks before the donation. On the day of donation, make sure you are well hydrated so keep drinking plenty of fluids. One should wear comfortable clothes during the donation process. In case you are undergoing any treatment or medication, it is advisable to inform the blood bank/clinic/hospital where you are donating blood.<br><br>
						</div><br>
						<div class="about5">
						<center>How often can you donate blood?</center><br>
							One has to wait for 56 days or 8 weeks between the whole blood donations. The wait period is 112 days or 16 weeks between power red donations. Avoid donation if suffering from any disorders and consult doctor before doing it.<br><br>
						<center>How much blood do you donate?</center><br>
						You can donate one unit or 350 ml of blood every 8 weeks. Organizations such as American Red Cross organize donation camps Where one can participate and donate blood. You can also donate blood at any hospital.<br><br>
						<center>How old do you have to be to donate blood?</center><br>
							Donor’s age must be between 18-60 years and weight more than 45 kgs to be able to donate blood. Any healthy person can donate blood after the required gap of 56 days. This wait time helps to replenish the blood levels in donor’s body.
